AI can be used as a transformer in enhancing the performance of GPUs in a number of ways. One way is to use AI to optimize the scheduling of workloads on the GPU. 
This can be done by taking into account the characteristics of the workload, such as its size and complexity, as well as the capabilities of the GPU.

Another way to use AI to enhance GPU performance is to tune the GPU's hardware configuration. This can include adjusting the clock speed, memory bandwidth, and other parameters to get the best performance for the specific workload.

AI can also be used to optimize the software stack that runs on the GPU. This can include optimizing the compiler, libraries, and frameworks that are used to develop and deploy AI applications.

In addition to these general-purpose approaches, AI can also be used to optimize specific GPU workloads. For example, AI can be used to optimize the performance of transformer-based models, which are a type of deep learning model that are commonly used for natural language processing tasks.

Here are some specific examples of how AI can be used as a transformer in enhancing the performance of GPUs:

NVIDIA's Transformer Engine is an AI-powered technology that is designed to improve the performance of transformer-based models on GPUs. The Transformer Engine uses AI to dynamically choose between different numerical formats, such as FP8 and FP16, to achieve the best performance while maintaining accuracy.

Google's READ method is an AI-powered technique for fine-tuning large transformer models. READ uses AI to identify the most important parts of the model to fine-tune, which can significantly reduce the amount of computation required.

Meta AI's MIMO-Transformer is an AI-powered architecture for transformer-based models. MIMO-Transformer uses AI to distribute the computation of a transformer model across multiple GPUs, which can improve performance and reduce power consumption.

These are just a few examples of how AI can be used as a transformer in enhancing the performance of GPUs. As AI technology continues to develop, it is likely that we will see even more innovative ways to use AI to improve the performance of GPUs for a variety of workloads.
